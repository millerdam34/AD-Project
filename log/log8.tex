\maketitle
\section*{Targets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Flesh out operator overloads in both forward and reverse implementation
\item Figure out how to have each operator add Node to tape without passing tape as an arument
\end{itemize}

\section*{Accomplishments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Researched methods for computing second order derivatives 
\item Made progress towards hessian matrix implementation
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to use dual numbers to obtain the derivative of the gradient function returned from reverse pass
\item What exactly makes revserse-forward the optimal method to compute the hessian
\end{itemize}

\section*{Goals}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement hessian computation in Julia
\item Understand the complexity differences between different combinations of reverse and forward passes
\end{itemize}
