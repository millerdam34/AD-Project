\section*{Targets}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implement hessian computation in Julia
\item Understand the complexity differences between different combinations of reverse and forward passes
\end{itemize}

\section*{Accomplishments}
\begin{itemize}
\item Implemented hessian computations in both forward-forward and reverse-forward
\item Solved the issue with tape size
\item Abstracted forward mode derivative function to handle arbitrary direction vectors
\end{itemize}

\section*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item How to solve the issue with overlapping tapes in forward-reverse and reverse-reverse implementations?
\item How to abstract forward mode implementation for any order derivative?
\item Differences between array versus tree based implementations of reverse mode?
\item Storing dependecies in node for efficent updates?
\item How to reuse duplicate nodes? (book example)
\item How to balance computation tree for parallelization? (product example)
\end{itemize}

\section*{Goals}
